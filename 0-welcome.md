# Python with Data Structures
Welcome to this tutorial of Python Data Structures and how to program with them. While you should know most of the basics of procedural programming in Python before beginning this tutorial, it should provide at least an intermediate grasp of the data structures covered in it

* [Stacks](1-Stack.md)
* [Linked LIsts](2-Linked%20List.md)
* [Trees](3-Tree.md)

Each of these tutorial modules will contain diagrams, descriptions, code examples, and two example problems (one solved, one unsolved), in an attempt to teach you how, when, and why to use each of these data structures in your future programming efforts.
